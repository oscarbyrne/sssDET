# Juice-shop test app

## To run tests
`sudo make e2e/run`

## Fix me
- allow to build juice-shop/Docker directly for test harness 
- reduce permissions on results bind mount
- figure out why PageObject.property is returning None

## To do
- switch over to playwright style asserts
- logging
- playwright REPL with POs
- linting for POs
- could use some tests for orchestration 
- add tooling unit tests where appropriate
- report results to a test management system
- roll into CI
- POs generation from yaml files
- stress testing via locust.io
