# QA Automation Exercise

## Preparation:

1. Create a new Gmail user or use an existing user for this exercise
2. Install/configure a test automation tool such as Selenium, Cypress or equivalent

## Exercise 1: New Email Test Automation

Write a script that performs the following automated test:

1) Log in to Gmail
2) Compose and send a new email to the same user logged in
3) When the new email arrives, move it to a newly created folder called "test1". Be sure to account for a delay in case Gmail is slow for some reason.
4) Delete the folder "test1"
5) Log out of Gmail

Note: The test can be initiated manually from the command line or testing IDE but should execute without human 
interaction. If the test ran a million times would you run out of space in your gmail account? (We do not recommend 
you run it a million times, although you should be able to now that your test is automated!)

Submit a screen recording (video) of the test operating, along with your code.

## Exercise 2: Test Cases Creation and Automation

Write out test cases that cover the following scenario:
1) Our web application login is similar to most websites in that our users are prompted for a userId and Password or prompted to use their SSO credentials (as configured with our customers) to log in
2) When creating a password, users are required to enter a moderate level of password complexity
3) A user can reset their password via our forgot password feature, in which they can specify their userId and an email is sent with instructions on how to reset their password
4) At a high level, write notes on how could you automate some of these test cases? Which ones would you automate and why?

Submit a text file enumerating the test case descriptions and any notes from part 4 regarding automation.

## Exercise 3: Personal Story

Explain a real-life situation that you recently found yourself in where you stopped yourself and questioned 
'the quality of that'. 

For example, you make a pizza and quickly cut it into 6 pieces. You find yourself asking if you cut it fairly by 
starting to calculate the volume of each piece for each millimetre off with your cuts. Then you shake your head, 
return to reality, and make a mental note to cut pizza into 8 pieces next time because you can do it more accurately :)

## Bonus question

Why do you think pizza is usually round?
